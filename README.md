Scheduling things can be difficult, due to timezones. Thankfully, Discord allows you to automatically convert between timezones, using a unix timestamp.

For example, `<t:1673047800>` is `January 6, 2023 5:30 PM` in my local time zone, but if you lived somewhere else, Discord would display that timestamp in your own local time zone.

But most people don't know what a unix timestamp is, so this simple webapp makes it easy for someone to input a date and time, and generate a ready-to-go timestamp code that can just be pasted into Discord without any worry.
